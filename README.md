# NoteLinkDemo

I wrote this when I was learning Java.

The idea is you can keep a collection of hyperlinked notes, but without writing markup.
Instead the convention is that you write documents as if they are articles in wikipedia, with a descriptive title at the top. If this title is found in any other document in the same directory it becomes a link back to the first one. The title is any text written before the first carriage return. These links only exist in the editing views generated by the program, the underlying files are just plain text. 

You can also see a  force directed graph of the links.
